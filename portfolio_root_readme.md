## 🌟 About This Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a **real-world, enterprise-ready showcase** of my work as a Data Engineer specializing in **Google Cloud Platform**.\
Inside, you'll find fully-documented, production-grade examples of:

- **Batch Data Pipelines** (BigQuery, Dataproc, Airflow, PySpark)
- **Real-Time Streaming Pipelines** (Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Apache Beam)
- **End-to-End Cloud Data Architectures**
- **Infrastructure, Security, and Setup Guides**
- **Best Practices for Modern Data Engineering**

All projects are **modeled after real client use cases** from the healthcare, e-commerce, and analytics industries, demonstrating proficiency in both **ETL/ELT** and **streaming/real-time analytics**.

## 🏆 Project Highlights

### **Batch Pipelines (GCP/Enterprise ETL)**

- Automated extraction from MySQL → GCS (CSV, Parquet) using PySpark and Dataproc
- Optimized BigQuery loads with partitioning, clustering, and cost-effective query design
- End-to-end orchestration with Apache Airflow (Cloud Composer)
- Realistic examples from e-commerce and healthcare batch analytics

### **Streamline (Streaming) Pipelines**

- Real-time ingestion from APIs to Pub/Sub
- Apache Beam (Dataflow) streaming:
  - Pub/Sub → GCS (partitioned data lake)
  - Pub/Sub → BigQuery (with audit columns, clustering, security)
- Producer and consumer scripts for true event-driven pipelines
- Partitioning, windowing, and cloud-native best practices

### **Data Engineer Workspace & Setup**

- API VM setup (Gunicorn/Flask) with GCP Secret Manager integration
- Secure firewall, IAM, and cloud onboarding scripts
- Terraform, Ansible, and Linux automation for cloud data engineering

## 💼 Why This Portfolio Stands Out

- **Production-Ready:** Each component is built and documented as it would be in a real enterprise (auditable, scalable, secure)
- **Cloud-Native:** 100% GCP-centric with hands-on use of BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Composer, GCS, IAM, GSM, etc.
- **Breadth & Depth:** Covers both batch and streaming (end-to-end), with best practices and real error-handling/logging.
- **Collaboration-Ready:** All code is version-controlled (Git), readable, and comes with onboarding guides.
- **Direct Client Value:** Every example is based on what delivered actual business value for Fortune 500-like clients.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies Demonstrated

- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Dataflow, GCS, Pub/Sub, Composer, Compute Engine), AWS, Azure
- **Programming:** Python, SQL, PySpark, Bash
- **Big Data:** Apache Spark, Apache Beam, Dataproc, Airflow (Composer)
- **DevOps:** Terraform, Ansible, Linux, systemd
- **Data Modeling:** Partitioning, clustering, audit columns, time travel, BQ views, and snapshots
- **Security:** IAM, GSM (Secret Manager), API Key management, audit logging
- **Collaboration:** Git, Agile, CI/CD
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio, Google Sheets

## 🚀 How to Use This Portfolio

Each folder contains:

- **README.md**: All steps and context to run or review the pipeline/component
- **Source code**: Production-ready scripts and configs
- **Troubleshooting & Q&A**: For interviews and live operations

**Want to see my approach in action?**

- Clone any folder, follow the readme, and you’ll get a deployable data engineering artifact.

## 📈 What You’ll Actually See Here

- **GCP, For Real:** Every pipeline is hands-on—designed, deployed, and managed on Google Cloud, not just code samples.
- **Serious Tools:** If you’re a hiring manager, you’ll spot BigQuery, Airflow, Apache Beam, PySpark, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Linux automation, and modern DevOps woven throughout.
- **Cloud Engineering Mindset:** I care about structure, monitoring, auditability, and cost—not just shipping code. You’ll find IAM, Secret Manager, partitioned storage, and production-worthy patterns by default.
- **Built for Collaboration:** Every folder is readable, reproducible, and ready to be picked up by another engineer.
- **Always Growing:** Projects are updated with new tech and ideas. If you want something explained or see a gap, just ask—I treat this repo as my live workshop.
